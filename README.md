#Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
        Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
   1.Approach: Agile follows an iterative and incremental approach, delivering work in small cycles, while Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be 
               completed before moving to the next.
   2.Flexibility: Agile is highly flexible and allows changes at any stage of development, whereas Waterfall is rigid and making changes after the project starts is difficult and costly.
   3.Customer Involvement: Agile encourages continuous customer feedback and collaboration throughout the project, while Waterfall involves customers primarily in the initial 
                   requirement- gathering phase, with little involvement afterward.
   4.Project Suitability: Agile is best suited for dynamic and complex projects where requirements evolve, whereas Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined, stable requirements.
   5.Delivery Time: Agile delivers features incrementally in small iterations (sprints), ensuring continuous progress, while Waterfall delivers the final product only after all phases 
                    are completed.
  5.Testing: In Agile, testing happens throughout the development cycle, reducing the risk of major defects, whereas in Waterfall, testing is conducted only after development is 
              complete, which can lead to late discovery of issues.



#In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
              When Agile is More Beneficial than Waterfall
          Examples of Projects Where Agile Works Best:
   1.Software Startups & MVPs – Startups developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) need constant feedback to refine features. Example: A food delivery app that starts with basic 
                          functionality and gradually adds more features based on user demand.
   2.Mobile App Development – Apps require frequent updates and user feedback. Example: Mkulima Hub, where features like the marketplace, learning section, and community platform evolve 
                          based on farmers' needs.
   3.E-commerce Platforms – Online stores often require new features and improvements over time. Example: A custom e-commerce website where product filtering, payment gateways, and 
                          recommendation systems are iteratively improved.
   4.AI & Machine Learning Projects – AI models require continuous training, testing, and tweaking. Example: A chatbot for customer service that gets smarter with each iteration.
   5.Cybersecurity Applications – Security threats evolve, requiring continuous testing and updates. Example: A penetration testing tool that is regularly updated to detect new 
                         vulnerabilities.

                         When Waterfall is More Beneficial than Agile
  1.Government & Compliance-Based Projects – These require strict regulations and documentation. Example: A tax filing system for a government agency that must follow strict legal 
         guidelines.
  2.Banking & Financial Software – Security and precision are critical, and requirements are often fixed. Example: A bank’s core transaction system, where changes could cause compliance 
         or security issues.
  3.Infrastructure & Embedded Systems – Hardware-dependent systems must be well-planned and tested before release. Example: A hospital’s patient monitoring system, where reliability is 
         critical.
 4.Manufacturing & Construction Software – These industries follow strict timelines and predefined workflows. Example: A warehouse inventory management system, where all features must be 
         defined upfront.
 5.Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems – Large-scale systems require extensive planning and structured implementation. Example: A company-wide payroll system, where any changes c 
         ould disrupt employee salaries.
